# heart-failure-prediction

In this project, my goal is to develop a classification model capable of predicting whether a patient will survive or not. I use two methods: Random Forest and one boosting algorithm. This model will be executed on the dataset obtained from the following SQL query:
`SELECT * FROM ftds-hacktiv8-project.phase1_ftds_020_rmt.heart-failure`

This model achieved an 88% recall score for classifying the 'not survived' class and an 85% accuracy score.
